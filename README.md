This project is a Typescript study and I'm still working on it. The goal is to achieve [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/B2gEwGhJfC7xmEJqnZVsIG/Helladarion-Form) I created on Figma. It will collect data from a form and send to [Helladarion API](https://github.com/bolognini/helladarion), which is another on going project that I'm using to study Node.js. After that I'm planning to access this data on the final project, [Helladarion Codex](https://github.com/bolognini/helladarion-codex), where we have the T20 RPG System sheet with editable fields that persists information to build monsters for your RPG campaign üé≤.
